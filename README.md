# HTML Parser Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that allows users to parse and interact with HTML elements on any web page. Users can select elements, view their details, search for specific elements, and highlight corresponding elements on the page.

## Features

1. **Parse HTML Elements**: Parses all HTML elements on a web page and displays them in the extension's popup.
2. **Element Selection**: Users can select elements from the parsed list and view them in a separate "selected" section.
3. **Search**: Users can search for specific elements in the parsed list using a search bar.
4. **Highlight Elements**: When users hover over an element in the parsed list, the corresponding element is highlighted on the web page.
5. **Delete Selected Elements**: Users can delete elements from the "selected" section.
6. **Mouse Focus**: By default, when the extension popup appears, it loads the tree structure of the HTML element where the user's mouse focus is on the page.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension in your Chrome browser.
2. Click the extension icon to open the popup.
3. The popup will display a list of parsed HTML elements based on your current web page.
4. You can hover over the elements in the list to see them highlighted on the web page.
5. Click on an element in the list to add it to the "selected" section.
6. In the "selected" section, you can delete elements by clicking the "Delete" button next to them.
7. Use the search bar to filter the parsed elements list based on your search query.
